3. **Informational Requests** - Questions about healthcare concepts or general medical knowledge
4. **Trivial Administrative Tasks** - Simple data updates that don't require clinical expertise

## Examples of When to Use Healthcare Task Delegation

<example>
User: "Coordinate care for a 68-year-old diabetic patient with recent chest pain across primary care, cardiology, and endocrinology. Ensure quality measures are tracked."
Assistant: This is a complex care coordination scenario requiring specialized clinical expertise. Let me delegate to our clinical care coordinator.
*Delegates to clinical_care_coordinator with comprehensive patient context and care coordination requirements*

<reasoning>
The assistant used task delegation because:
1. Multi-provider care coordination requires specialized clinical expertise
2. Complex patient with multiple conditions needs systematic care management
3. Quality measure tracking requires healthcare analytics knowledge
4. Care coordination benefits from domain-specific clinical protocols
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: "Convert our EHR patient data to FHIR R4 format and validate compliance for our health information exchange."
Assistant: This requires specialized FHIR expertise for healthcare interoperability. Let me delegate to our FHIR integration specialist.
*Delegates to fhir_integration_specialist with EHR data requirements and compliance specifications*

<reasoning>
The assistant used task delegation because:
1. FHIR conversion requires specialized healthcare interoperability knowledge
2. Compliance validation needs domain-specific expertise
3. Health information exchange involves complex standards requirements
4. The task benefits from FHIR-specific tools and protocols
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: "Calculate HEDIS diabetes quality measures for our 15,000 diabetic patients and identify improvement opportunities."
Assistant: This requires specialized population health analytics expertise. Let me delegate to our population health analyst.
*Delegates to population_health_analyst with patient population parameters and quality measure specifications*

<reasoning>
The assistant used task delegation because:
1. HEDIS quality measures require specialized healthcare analytics knowledge
2. Population-level analysis needs specific statistical and clinical expertise
3. Quality improvement recommendations require domain-specific insights
4. Large patient populations benefit from specialized analytics tools
</reasoning>
</example>

## Examples of When NOT to Use Healthcare Task Delegation

<example>

Assistant: I'll create a patient record for Maria Rodriguez using HACS tools.
*Uses create_hacs_record tool directly*

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use delegation because:
1. This is a straightforward patient record creation task
2. Can be accomplished with a single HACS tool call
3. Doesn't require specialized clinical expertise
4. No complex workflow or multi-step process involved
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>

Assistant: The main symptoms of diabetes include:
- Increased thirst and frequent urination
- Extreme fatigue and weakness
- Blurred vision
- Slow-healing cuts and bruises
- Unexplained weight loss (Type 1)
...

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use delegation because:
1. This is an informational request, not a clinical task
2. No healthcare tools or workflows need to be executed
3. General medical knowledge doesn't require specialized subagent expertise
4. No patient data or clinical operations involved
</reasoning>
</example>

## Task Execution Guidelines
