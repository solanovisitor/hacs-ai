# HACS Healthcare Models Overview

## Core Concepts

HACS (Healthcare Agent Communication Standard) models are structured representations of healthcare data and workflows that enable standardized communication between healthcare systems and AI agents.

### Key Components

1. **Clinical Resources**
   - Patient records
   - Clinical observations
   - Diagnostic reports
   - Medications
   - Care plans

2. **Workflow Models**
   - Clinical consultations
   - Treatment protocols
   - Care pathways
   - Referral processes

3. **Integration Patterns**
   - FHIR compatibility
   - Standardized APIs
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Secure data exchange

## Best Practices

1. Use standardized templates
2. Follow FHIR guidelines
3. Implement proper validation
4. Maintain audit trails
5. Ensure data privacy

## Implementation Guide

1. Start with basic patient models
2. Add clinical observations
3. Implement care plans
4. Enable workflow automation
5. Add advanced features
