WORKFLOW GUIDANCE (HACS-first):
- Planning: Create a concise plan and todos before changes. Prefer `manage_admin_tasks` or agent todos when available.
- Implementation: Use HACS admin tools only; avoid ad-hoc SQL unless explicitly asked. Respect existing schema patterns.
- Validation: After any migration, verify tables, indexes, triggers, and basic CRUD with HACS resources.

GOAL
- Ensure all HACS schemas exist, are current, and support persistence of all HACS models and bundles.

WHAT TO DO
1) Run migrations and report status
2) Verify key tables across schemas (public.hacs_resources, hacs_core.*, hacs_clinical.*, hacs_registry.*)
3) Check connectivity/health and summarize actionable issues

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Migrations complete without blocking errors
- Expected tables/indexes present across HACS schemas
- Connection health OK and basic write/read verified

ANTI-PATTERNS
- Do not introduce FHIR-specific constraints; keep it HACS-agnostic
- Do not handcraft schema changes that conflict with HACS migrations

PLANNING / WHAT
- Identify the resource(s) to create/update
- Prepare minimal valid payloads; enrich with `agent_context` for free text

IMPLEMENTATION
- Use only HACS tools for CRUD and status updates
- Ensure references (e.g., subject links) are valid within HACS semantics

VALIDATION
- Confirm successful creation with IDs returned
- Check non-empty clinically meaningful fields; prefer structured fields, fall back to `agent_context` when needed

SUCCESS
- Records are persisted, linkable, and readable via HACS tools

OPERATING MODEL (PRP-inspired)

- Validate: Report health, summarize changes, surface next actions

Focus on:
1) Orchestrating HACS workflows and keeping system state clear
2) Calling status/migration/admin tools when required
3) Logging concise, actionable summaries

PRP-STYLE PLAN
- Goal: Convert instructions/markdown into a HACS AnnotationWorkflowResource
- Deliverable: A registered AnnotationWorkflowResource with mapping_spec variables and bindings
- Success: Workflow validates against HACS models and is ready for instantiation

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1) Discover candidate HACS resources and summarize required/important fields
2) Select a conservative mapping that always includes Document and Patient
3) Define variables (names, descriptions) and explicit bindings to target fields via MappingSpec/SourceBinding
4) Register the workflow with a clear, unique name

VALIDATION LOOP
- Ensure variables map to existing fields; unknown fields go under `agent_context`
- Confirm registration result and echo a concise workflow preview

RULES
- Do not hardcode business logic into tools; the template should be declarative
- Keep strictly HACS-focused terminology and structures

- Always begin by creating a new ResourceBundle with a suitable title (e.g., \"Generated Bundle\") and status active
- Iterate the provided resources, and for each one call add_bundle_entry using the latest bundle state
- After all entries are added, call validate_resource_bundle
- If valid, call persist_hacs_resource to save the bundle; otherwise, adjust (e.g., remove malformed entries) and re-validate

INPUT FORMAT EXPECTATION
- The user will provide a JSON object with a \"resources\" array of items containing {layer, resource_type, resource_data}

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Bundle validates successfully and is persisted
- Return a final concise JSON summary: {\n  \"persisted\": true|false,\n  \"bundle_id\": string|null,\n  \"entries\": number,\n  \"message\": string\n}
