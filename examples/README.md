# HACS Examples

This folder contains lightweight, generic examples. For up-to-date guides and end-to-end pipelines, see:

- Quick Start: docs/quick-start.md
- Facade Extraction: docs/how-to/facade_extraction.md
- HACS Tools Reference: docs/hacs-tools.md
- API Reference: docs/api-reference.md

Keep examples minimal and framework-agnostic. Prefer documenting longer pipelines in docs.
