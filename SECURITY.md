## üè• Healthcare-Specific Security

### Protected Health Information (PHI)
HACS implements specific protections for PHI:

```python
from hacs_core import Patient, secure_field

class Patient(BaseResource):
    # Public fields
    id: str
    active: bool

    # Protected fields - automatically encrypted
    name: list[HumanName] = secure_field()
    birth_date: str = secure_field()
    address: list[Address] = secure_field()
    telecom: list[ContactPoint] = secure_field()
```

### Data Handling Best Practices
- **No PHI in Logs** - Sensitive data automatically redacted
- **Secure Defaults** - All integrations secure by default
- **Data Isolation** - Multi-tenant data separation
- **Backup Encryption** - All backups encrypted and access-controlled

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning
We run automated security scans on every commit:

- **Static Code Analysis** - SAST scanning with CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning** - Vulnerability scanning of all dependencies
- **Secret Detection** - Scanning for accidentally committed secrets
- **Container Scanning** - Docker image vulnerability assessment

### Penetration Testing
- **Annual Penetration Tests** - Third-party security assessments
- **Bug Bounty Program** - Responsible disclosure rewards
- **Red Team Exercises** - Internal security testing

### Security Monitoring
- **Runtime Protection** - Application security monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection** - Unusual access pattern detection
- **Threat Intelligence** - Integration with security feeds

## üö´ Common Vulnerabilities

### What We Protect Against

#### 1. Data Injection Attacks
```python
# ‚úÖ Safe: Using parameterized queries
def get_patient(patient_id: str) -> Patient:
    return session.query(Patient).filter(Patient.id == patient_id).first()

# ‚ùå Vulnerable: String concatenation
def get_patient_unsafe(patient_id: str) -> Patient:
    query = f"SELECT * FROM patients WHERE id = '{patient_id}'"
    return session.execute(query)
```

#### 2. Unauthorized Data Access
```python
# ‚úÖ Safe: Actor-based access control
def get_patient_data(patient_id: str, actor: Actor) -> Patient:
    if not actor.has_permission("read_patient"):
        raise PermissionError("Insufficient permissions")
    return get_patient(patient_id)

# ‚ùå Vulnerable: No access control
def get_patient_data_unsafe(patient_id: str) -> Patient:
    return get_patient(patient_id)
```

#### 3. Data Leakage in Logs
```python
# ‚úÖ Safe: Redacted logging
logger.info(f"Processing patient {patient.id}")  # Only ID logged

# ‚ùå Vulnerable: PHI in logs
logger.info(f"Processing patient {patient.name}")  # PHI exposed
```

### Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Hardcoded Secrets
```python
# ‚ùå Never do this
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"

# ‚úÖ Use environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

#### 2. Overprivileged Access
```python
# ‚ùå Too permissive
actor = Actor(permissions=["*"])

# ‚úÖ Principle of least privilege
actor = Actor(permissions=["read_patient", "write_observation"])
```

#### 3. Unvalidated Input
```python
# ‚ùå No validation
def create_patient(data: dict) -> Patient:
    return Patient(**data)

# ‚úÖ Proper validation
def create_patient(data: dict) -> Patient:
    validated_data = PatientCreateSchema(**data)
    return Patient(**validated_data.dict())
```
