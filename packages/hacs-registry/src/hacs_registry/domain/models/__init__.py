Domain Models Following SOLID Principles

This module contains all domain models (entities, value objects, aggregates)
that represent the core business concepts in the HACS Registry.

SOLID Compliance:
- S: Single Responsibility - Each model represents one business concept
- O: Open/Closed - Models are extensible through inheritance
- L: Liskov Substitution - All models follow their base contracts
- I: Interface Segregation - Focused model interfaces
- D: Dependency Inversion - Models depend on abstractions

Model Categories:
    üè• Resource Models - Healthcare resource management
    ü§ñ Agent Models - AI agent lifecycle and configuration
    üîê IAM Models - Identity and access management
    üîß Tool Models - Tool registration and execution
