"""
HACS Registry Core - Foundational Abstractions

This module provides the core abstractions that follow SOLID principles:

S - Single Responsibility: Each interface has one clear purpose
O - Open/Closed: Extensible through inheritance, closed for modification  
L - Liskov Substitution: All implementations are substitutable
I - Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
D - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

Core Patterns:
    üèóÔ∏è Repository Pattern - Data access abstraction
    üì¢ Event System - Decoupled communication
    üè≠ Factory Pattern - Object creation abstraction
    üîç Specification Pattern - Business rules encapsulation
