Monitoring Infrastructure Following SOLID Principles

This module provides monitoring, auditing, and compliance infrastructure
for the HACS Registry system.

SOLID Compliance:
- S: Single Responsibility - Each monitor handles one aspect
- O: Open/Closed - Extensible through new monitoring types
- L: Liskov Substitution - All monitors implement consistent contracts
- I: Interface Segregation - Focused monitoring interfaces
- D: Dependency Inversion - Monitors depend on abstractions
