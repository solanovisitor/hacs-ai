Integration Infrastructure Following SOLID Principles

This module provides infrastructure adapters for integrating with
external frameworks and services.

SOLID Compliance:
- S: Single Responsibility - Each adapter handles one integration
- O: Open/Closed - Extensible through new adapter implementations
- L: Liskov Substitution - All adapters implement consistent contracts
- I: Interface Segregation - Focused adapter interfaces
- D: Dependency Inversion - Adapters implement abstract interfaces
