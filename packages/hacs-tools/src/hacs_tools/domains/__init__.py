HACS Tools Domains - 4-Domain Tool Organization

This package organizes HACS tools into 4 core domains for healthcare AI agents:

Domain Organization:
    üîß modeling - Resource instantiation, validation, composition, diffing
    üîç extraction - Structured extraction, mapping specs, context summarization  
    üíæ database - Typed/generic CRUD, registry ops, vector search, migrations
    ü§ñ agents - Scratchpad, todos, memory, preferences, tool loadout, state management
    üß¨ terminology (optional) - UMLS-based code search/match helpers (kept separate from modeling)

All domains use standardized result types from hacs_core.HACSResult
and follow healthcare compliance standards.
