HACS Clinical Workflows Tools

This module provides comprehensive tools for clinical workflow execution,
decision support, and healthcare protocol management. Supports FHIR-compliant
clinical reasoning and evidence-based care protocols.

Key Features:
    🏥 Clinical workflow execution using PlanDefinition
    🧠 AI-powered clinical decision support
    📋 Healthcare protocol automation
    🔍 Evidence-based clinical reasoning
    📊 Clinical data requirements processing
    ⚡ Real-time guidance generation

All tools use WorkflowResult, GuidanceResult, and DataQueryResult from
hacs_core.results for consistent clinical response formatting.
