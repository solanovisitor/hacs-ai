HACS Core Agent Types

Fundamental types for HACS agents that are used across all packages.
These are the base types that all agent implementations should use for consistency.

Core principles:
    ü§ñ Foundation types for all healthcare agents
    üîÑ Reusable across different frameworks and contexts
    üìã Version-controlled and persistent
    ‚öôÔ∏è Framework-agnostic agent definitions
    üè• Healthcare-specific agent specializations
