## 🔄 **Workflow Patterns**

### **🚀 Feature Development Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Develop with healthcare standards
# - Follow FHIR compliance
# - Add comprehensive tests
# - Include clinical documentation
# - Implement audit logging

# 4. Quality assurance
uv run pytest tests/test_ci_essential.py
uv run ruff check packages/ --fix
uv run python publish.py --check

# 5. Push and create PR to develop
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Open PR: feature/your-feature-name → develop
```

### **🏥 Clinical Feature Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# 2. Create clinical branch
git checkout -b clinical/care-pathway-name

# 3. Clinical development requirements
# - FHIR resource validation
# - Healthcare professional review
# - Clinical scenario testing
# - Regulatory compliance check

# 4. Clinical validation
uv run pytest tests/test_clinical_scenarios.py
# Manual review by healthcare professionals

# 5. Push and create PR with clinical review
git push origin clinical/care-pathway-name
# Open PR: clinical/care-pathway-name → develop
# Require: Healthcare professional approval
```

### **🔒 Security Feature Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# 2. Create security branch
git checkout -b security/feature-name

# 3. Security development requirements
# - HIPAA compliance validation
# - Security audit logging
# - Penetration testing preparation
# - Privacy impact assessment

# 4. Security validation
uv run pytest tests/test_security_compliance.py
# Security review by security team

# 5. Push with security review requirement
git push origin security/feature-name
# Open PR: security/feature-name → develop  
# Require: Security team approval
```

### **⚡ Hotfix Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Start from main (production)
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-description

# 3. Minimal, focused fix
# - Address only the critical issue
# - Maintain production stability
# - Add regression tests

# 4. Thorough testing
uv run pytest
uv run python publish.py --check

# 5. Create PRs to BOTH main and develop
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue-description
# Open PR: hotfix/critical-issue-description → main
# Open PR: hotfix/critical-issue-description → develop
```

### **🚀 Release Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# 2. Release preparation
# - Update version numbers in all packages
# - Run comprehensive test suite
# - Update documentation
# - Prepare release notes

# 3. Release validation
uv run pytest --comprehensive
uv run python publish.py --test  # TestPyPI validation
# Healthcare compliance review
# Security audit (if required)

# 4. Merge to main and tag
# PR: release/v1.2.0 → main
git tag v1.2.0
uv run python publish.py --production

# 5. Merge back to develop
# PR: release/v1.2.0 → develop
```

## 🏥 **Healthcare-Specific Branch Policies**

### **Clinical Branches (`clinical/*`)**
- **Reviewers Required**: Healthcare professional + Technical lead
- **Testing**: Clinical scenario validation mandatory
- **Documentation**: Clinical workflow documentation required
- **Compliance**: FHIR validation must pass

### **Security Branches (`security/*`)**
- **Reviewers Required**: Security team + Technical lead  
- **Testing**: Security compliance tests mandatory
- **Documentation**: Privacy impact assessment required
- **Compliance**: HIPAA compliance validation required

### **FHIR Branches (`fhir/*`)**
- **Reviewers Required**: FHIR specialist + Technical lead
- **Testing**: FHIR conformance testing mandatory
- **Documentation**: FHIR implementation guide updates
- **Compliance**: Healthcare standards validation required

## 🛡️ **Branch Protection Rules**

### **Main Branch Protection**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers minimum)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging  
- ✅ Require linear history
- ✅ Restrict pushes (admins only)
- ✅ Allow force pushes (admins only)

### **Develop Branch Protection**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer minimum)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Allow squash merging

### **Healthcare-Specific Protection**
- **Clinical branches**: Require healthcare professional review
- **Security branches**: Require security team review  
- **FHIR branches**: Require FHIR compliance validation
- **Performance branches**: Require benchmark validation

## 📋 **Branch Naming Conventions**

### **Standard Prefixes**
- `feature/` - New functionality and enhancements
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes for develop branch
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes for production
- `release/` - Release preparation branches
- `docs/` - Documentation improvements

### **Healthcare-Specific Prefixes**
- `clinical/` - Clinical workflow implementations
- `fhir/` - FHIR standard implementations
- `security/` - Healthcare security features
- `experimental/` - Research and experimental features

### **Quality & Testing Prefixes**
- `test/` - Test improvements and new test suites
- `performance/` - Performance optimizations
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without feature changes

### **Naming Guidelines**
```bash
# Good branch names
feature/patient-risk-assessment
clinical/diabetes-care-pathway  
fhir/r5-observation-support
security/audit-trail-enhancement
hotfix/memory-leak-in-vector-store

# Avoid generic names
feature/fix-bug
feature/improvement
feature/update
```

## 🔄 **Merge Strategies**

### **Feature → Develop**
- **Strategy**: Squash and merge
- **Benefits**: Clean history, single commit per feature
- **Requirements**: All tests pass, code review approved

### **Develop → Main**
- **Strategy**: Merge commit (via release branch)
- **Benefits**: Preserve development history
- **Requirements**: Release validation complete

### **Hotfix → Main**
- **Strategy**: Merge commit  
- **Benefits**: Preserve emergency fix traceability
- **Requirements**: Critical fix validation, minimal changes

### **Release → Main**
- **Strategy**: Merge commit
- **Benefits**: Clear release boundaries
- **Requirements**: Full release validation complete

## 📊 **Branch Metrics & Monitoring**

### **Health Metrics**
- **Active branches**: Monitor for stale branches
- **Merge frequency**: Track development velocity
- **Review time**: Monitor collaboration efficiency
- **Test coverage**: Ensure quality standards

### **Healthcare Compliance Metrics**
- **FHIR validation rate**: Track standards compliance
- **Security review completion**: Monitor security posture
- **Clinical review participation**: Ensure healthcare expertise
- **Audit trail completeness**: Verify compliance requirements

## 🎯 **Best Practices Summary**

### **✅ Do's**
- Always start feature branches from `develop`
- Use descriptive, healthcare-context branch names
- Include healthcare professionals in clinical reviews
- Validate FHIR compliance before merging
- Add comprehensive tests with clinical scenarios
- Document healthcare-specific requirements

### **❌ Don'ts**
- Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`
- Don't use generic branch names
- Don't skip healthcare compliance validation
- Don't merge without proper clinical review (for clinical features)
- Don't ignore security requirements for healthcare data
- Don't deploy without FHIR validation
