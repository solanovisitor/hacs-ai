# ADR-001: SOLID Principles Compliance in HACS Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - Implemented across all HACS packages

## Context
The HACS (Healthcare Agent Communication Standard) project requires a maintainable, extensible, and testable architecture to support complex healthcare AI workflows. As the system grew from initial prototypes to a production-ready framework, we needed to ensure consistent application of software engineering best practices.

## Decision
We will strictly adhere to SOLID principles across all HACS packages, with specific focus on:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each package has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Actor authentication logic moved to dedicated `hacs-auth` package
- Permission management separated from actor identity management
- Session management extracted to dedicated classes

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Protocol-based architecture enables extension without modification
- Tool registry pattern allows new tools without core changes
- Framework adapters support multiple AI frameworks (LangChain, MCP, etc.)
- Healthcare tool decorators provide extensible metadata

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All protocol implementations are fully substitutable
- BaseResource hierarchy maintains consistent behavior
- Framework adapters preserve expected interfaces
- Type adapters maintain conversion contracts

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Small, focused protocols (Identifiable, Timestamped, Versioned)
- Compositional interface design for complex entities
- Tool protocols separated by responsibility
- No large, monolithic interfaces

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions (protocols)
- Comprehensive dependency injection container
- Framework-agnostic tool implementations
- Configuration abstraction throughout

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Testability**: Dependency injection enables comprehensive unit testing
- **Extensibility**: Protocol-based design allows easy addition of new providers and tools
- **Framework Independence**: Tools work across multiple AI frameworks without modification
- **Healthcare Compliance**: Clean architecture supports audit trails and security requirements

### Negative
- **Initial Complexity**: More upfront design required for proper abstractions
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand protocols and dependency injection
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional abstraction layers may impact performance slightly

## Implementation Details

### Package Structure
```
hacs-models/      # Pure data models (SRP)
hacs-auth/        # Authentication and authorization (SRP)
hacs-core/        # Base infrastructure and protocols (DIP)
hacs-tools/       # Tool implementations (OCP)
hacs-registry/    # Resource registration (OCP)
hacs-persistence/ # Data storage abstractions (DIP)
hacs-infrastructure/ # Dependency injection (DIP)
hacs-utils/       # Framework integrations (LSP)
hacs-cli/         # Command-line interface (SRP)
```

### Key Protocols
```python
# Small, focused interfaces (ISP)
@runtime_checkable
class Identifiable(Protocol):
    @property
    def id(self) -> str: ...

@runtime_checkable
class ClinicalResource(Protocol):
    def validate_clinical_data(self) -> bool: ...

# Compositional design
class ClinicalEntity(Identifiable, Timestamped, ClinicalResource, Protocol):
    pass
```

### Dependency Injection
```python
# DIP: High-level modules depend on abstractions
def execute_clinical_workflow(
    patient_provider: PersistenceProvider,  # Protocol, not concrete class
    llm_provider: LLMProvider,              # Protocol, not concrete class
    workflow_engine: WorkflowEngine         # Protocol, not concrete class
) -> WorkflowResult:
    pass
```

## Monitoring
We continuously monitor SOLID compliance through:
- Static analysis tools (mypy, ruff)
- Architecture tests in CI/CD
- Code review guidelines
- Regular architecture reviews
