HACS (Healthcare Agent Communication Standard) is a protocol‚Äëfirst framework for building healthcare AI agents. It provides healthcare‚Äënative models, tools, and security to implement the four essential strategies of context engineering ‚Äî Write, Select, Compress, Isolate ‚Äî safely and efficiently.

## Get started

```bash
pip install -U hacs-core hacs-auth hacs-models hacs-tools hacs-utils hacs-persistence
```

- Try the runnable LangGraph developer agent: `examples/hacs_developer_agent/`
- Use `docker-compose.yml` to start the MCP server and PostgreSQL (with pgvector)

## Core benefits

- Healthcare context engineering: built‚Äëin patterns to write clinical memory, select essential data, compress safely, and isolate per regulatory boundaries
- Actor‚Äëbased security: roles, permissions, and audit trails designed for PHI and compliance
- FHIR‚Äëaligned models: type‚Äësafe Pydantic models for Patient, Observation, Encounter, and more
- Protocol‚Äëfirst tools (MCP): 40+ tools exposed via Model Context Protocol, usable from any agent framework
- Framework integrations: Works with LangGraph/LangChain and any LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

## Packages at a glance

- `hacs-core`: Clinical protocols and foundational abstractions
- `hacs-models`: Pure, FHIR‚Äëaligned healthcare data models
- `hacs-tools`: 40+ HACS tools for clinical workflows and data operations
- `hacs-utils`: Integrations, MCP server, and developer utilities
- `hacs-persistence`: PostgreSQL + pgvector adapters and repositories
- `hacs-registry`: Resource and tool registration, validation, and versioning
- `hacs-auth`: Authentication, actors, permissions, and audit logging

See package READMEs and the docs for details.

## Optional services

- MCP Server: expose HACS tools via JSON‚ÄëRPC and streamable HTTP
- PostgreSQL + pgvector: persistence and vector search for clinical embeddings
- LangGraph Developer Agent: a ready‚Äëto‚Äërun agent for local development
